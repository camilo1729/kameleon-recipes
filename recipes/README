# Kameleon recipes naming convention 

This readme explains the naming convention that should be followed when naming a recipe.
Which is as follows:

distrib_version_software-added_architecture.yaml

Which would give something like:

* debian_etch_oar_i386.yaml
* debian_squeeze_mysql_amd64.yaml
* debian_lenny_slurm_amd64.yaml
* archlinux_mpi_amd64.yaml
* centos_6_oar_amd64.yaml
