   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Kameleon's documentation!
====================================

Kameleon should be seen as a simple but powerful tool to generate customized
appliances. With Kameleon, you make your recipe that describes how to create
step by step your own distribution. At start Kameleon is used to create custom
kvm, LXC, VirtualBox, iso images, ..., but as it is designed to be very generic
you can probably do a lot more than that.
