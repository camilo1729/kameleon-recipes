First thing to know is that Kameleon is an automation tool for bash. It brings
the ease of error handling, retry, checkpointing, easy debugging and cleaning
to your scripts to help you to build your software appliance.

The template system built-in allows you quickly build a system and to understand the
Kameleon basics.




There is no magic computation in Kameleon everything is written in YAML files:
from your system bootstrap to his export. It empowers you to customize anything
you want at anytime during the appliance build.

Using the :doc:`context` notion, it also manage the connection to your new appliance
and make it easy and reliable.
