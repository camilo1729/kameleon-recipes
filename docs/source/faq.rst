Why my step file is not valid?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you try to build your recipe, you gat this message::

  [global]: The macrostep /path/to/my/step/step.yaml is not valid

It means your step is not a valid YAML file. Be sure that you did not use some tabulations
instead of spaces or mix dictionnary and list in the same level. It is recommended to (re)read
the :doc:`recipe` documentation.
